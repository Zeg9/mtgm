* make it generate the map (by taking screenshots)
* remove all "useless" functionnality
   -> Make the "client" directly read the database, and remove support for server
   -> Remove entities (who cares about entities in a static map)
   -> Remove all UI (except, maybe, a world/file selection dialog)
* get all chunks before taking screenshot
* fix aspect ratio (current values are quite random, maybe find out the exact ones)

Reminder:

[map chunk position]
(player position)


  [0,1]          [1,1]
(-20,25,20)   (-10,25,30)


  [0,0]          [1,0]
(0,25,0)      (10,25,10)
