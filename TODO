Already done:
* Generate the map "by hand": press arrow keys, and screenshot.

To do:
* Generate the map automatically
* remove all "useless" functionnality
   -> Make the "client" directly read the database, and remove server and socket.*
   -> Entities: they currently won't render, but need to disable them completely
   -> Remove HUD
* get all chunks before taking screenshot
* fix aspect ratio (current values are quite random, maybe find out the exact ones)

Reminder:

[map chunk position]
(player position)


  [0,-1]          [1,-1]
(-20,25,20)   (-10,25,30)


  [0,0]          [1,0]
(0,25,0)      (10,25,10)
